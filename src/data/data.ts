      design: `The project aimed to create a mobile cross-platform application using React Native, catering to both younger and older demographics. Articles were formatted for easy reading on devices, with configurable settings to accommodate older users transitioning to digital platforms. While maintaining PDF access for research purposes, the app addressed various accessibility challenges. The design focused on customizable reading experiences, offering features like adjustable font sizes and dark/light mode themes. Additionally, users could bookmark articles, follow authors, and receive notifications for new publications.`,
      deliver: `Technologies employed included React Native, Hygraph (GraphQL), and Node.js. The app delivered a solution to accessibility and usability concerns on the academic journal's website.
